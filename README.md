Hi.

I'm trying to learn Scala by completing Advent Of Code 2017 Exercises.

For these exercises I'm striving to use immutable data and pure functions as much as I can.

I am a newbie so if some of this code is not idiomatic or problematic try not to judge me too harshly.

If you load the project up in Intellij IDEA, you should be able to run all of the tests.
